            <h3 class="title-blue">Reason #1. Incredible number of television channels </h3>
            <img src="images/img/charter-tv-offers.jpg" class="img-left" alt="Charter TV Offers" width="200" />
            <p>The primary reason to buy  Charter Spectrum TV packages is the incredible number of channels that you can  choose from. Charter Spectrum TV divides its packages into three main tiers – <strong>Select, Silver and Gold</strong> – and then  gives you a different number of channels with each of them. </p>
            <p>So here&rsquo;s what makes Charter  Spectrum TV so great – even if you get the most affordable package (Select),  you&rsquo;re still getting access to 125+ channels. With Silver, you&rsquo;re getting  access to 175+ channels. And with Gold, the very best package, you&rsquo;re getting  access to 200+ channels. That&rsquo;s just mind-boggling.</p>
            <p>And you&rsquo;re getting all the  best sports, entertainment, news and kids&rsquo; programming channels, too. For  example, with Select, you&rsquo;re getting ESPN for sports and CNN for news. Those  are usually the two channels that people can&rsquo;t live without, and they&rsquo;re  included! </p>
            <p>And, of course, you get all  the major broadcast channels, like ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX. But that&rsquo;s just the  beginning – you&rsquo;re also getting a lot of the great entertainment channels with  so many great new shows, like Hallmark, HGTV and A&amp;E. </p>

            <h3 class="title-blue">Reason #2. Premium movie channels </h3>
            <img src="images/img/charter-premium-movie-channels.jpg" class="img-right" alt="Charter Premium Movie Channels"  /><p>When you upgrade from Select  to Silver or Gold, that&rsquo;s when you start getting access to some truly epic  movie channels. For example, with Silver, you get HBO, Showtime and Cinemax. </p>
            <p>Those are easily the most  popular premium movie channels around, and you get them included in your Silver  package! With Gold, you get even more premium movie channels.</p>
            <p>At one time, these premium  movie channels just showed movies. Maybe there was an occasional concert or  comedy show, but it was mostly movies. But have you checked out the programming  on HBO, Showtime and Cinemax recently?</p>
            <p>They&rsquo;ve started to create  some amazing original series. The most obvious example, of course, is HBO. They  have given us so many great series, from &ldquo;The Sopranos&rdquo; to &ldquo;Sex and the City&rdquo;  to &ldquo;Girls&rdquo; to &ldquo;Game of Thrones.&rdquo; So even if you&rsquo;re not a huge movie fan, you&rsquo;re  still getting access to some of the best programming on TV these days. If  you&rsquo;re a fan of &ldquo;Game of Thrones,&rdquo; you will absolutely need to get HBO.</p>
            <h3 class="title-blue">Reason #3. Amazing HD quality </h3>
            <img src="images/img/charter-hd-channels.jpg" class="img-left" alt="Charter HD Channels"  /><p>When it comes to delivering a  crisp, crystal-clear picture, Charter Spectrum TV doesn&rsquo;t play around. Of all  the major cable companies, Charter Spectrum seems to believe in HD more than  anyone else. </p>
            <p>As a result, every channel is  delivered in beautiful, <a href="https://www.s9.com/charter/charter-hd.html">stunning High Definition quality whenever possible</a>. If you have an HDTV, you&rsquo;ll really appreciate  the difference. </p>
            <p>Did you know that HD delivers  6 times the screen resolution of SD? Imagine being able to watch your favorite  shows with the crispest, highest-resolution screen possible. If you&rsquo;re a sports  fan, you won&rsquo;t believe how cool it is to watch your favorite team in HD. </p>
            <p>Imagine watching a football  game and seeing your favorite stars up close! All these HD channels are free,  too. There&rsquo;s no hidden charge to get these HD channels.</p>

            <h3 class="title-blue">Reason #4. Free DVR included with every Spectrum  TV package </h3>
            <p>If you&rsquo;re like most people,  you probably enjoy watching TV on your own schedule, according to your own  needs. For example, if you work all day, you probably don&rsquo;t want to race home  at the end of the day to watch your favorite primetime shows. And if you go on  the occasional vacation, you probably want some convenient way to keep up with  all your shows, right? </p>
            <p>That&rsquo;s why Charter Spectrum  includes a free (FREE!) <a href="https://www.s9.com/charter/charter-spectrum-dvr.html">Digital Video Recorder</a> with every single TV package. With some cable  or satellite providers, the DVR might cost extra, or it might only be available  if you buy the most expensive TV package. But not with Charter Spectrum! As  long as you&rsquo;re a Charter Spectrum TV customer, you&rsquo;re getting the free DVR.</p>
            <img src="images/img/charter-hd-channel-options.jpg" class="img-left" alt="Charter HD Channel Options"  /> <p>This DVR can connect up to 4  different TV sets in your household, and it contains enough storage for the  entire season of any show. This makes it so easy and convenient to use. </p>
            <p>You probably like to  binge-watch shows, right? Well, that&rsquo;s a great way to use the free DVR. Record  an entire season of a show, and then binge-watch it with your DVR. </p>
            <p>And, as you start to explore  everything that Charter Spectrum offers, you&rsquo;ll simply be blown away by the  power of the DVR. You can use it to stop, rewind, or pause your shows. And you  can even use it to pause and then play &ldquo;live&rdquo; TV! Wait, doesn&rsquo;t this break the  laws of physics or something? </p>
            <p>Imagine telling one of your  friends that you have the power to pause &ldquo;live&rdquo; action and resume it at any time.  This used to be a plot device in science fiction films, but now it&rsquo;s a reality  for Charter Spectrum package subscribers. </p>
            <p>Imagine watching a baseball  game with your favorite team. If you&rsquo;re recording the game with your DVR, you  can &ldquo;pause&rdquo; the game to get up and get some popcorn or pizza, and then resume  it when you&rsquo;re back on the couch. That&rsquo;s just amazing – you never miss any of  the action!</p>
            <h3 class="title-blue">Reason #5. Over 10,000 On Demand titles </h3>
            <img src="images/img/charter-ondemand-programming.jpg" class="img-right" alt="Charter On Demand Programming"  /><p>When you find out that  Charter Spectrum TV offers over 10,000 titles On Demand, you&rsquo;ll probably want  to sign up immediately. Yes, that&rsquo;s right – Charter Spectrum has an incredible  archive of over 10,000 movies and shows that you can watch at any time. </p>
            <p>This really gives you some  amazing power to control your own personal entertainment experience. It might  be 2:00 am in the morning, but you can still be assured that you have access to  the most amazing shows and movies.</p>
            <p>Many of these On Demand  offerings are free, too. For example, Charter Spectrum TV has a really cool  feature called &ldquo;Free Primetime On Demand.&rdquo; That name says it all. What it means  for you, the viewer, is that you get any single show on primetime, completely  free at any time. </p>
            <p>You get all the best  primetime shows, from NBC, ABC, CBS or FOX. So, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re favorite  primetime show comes on every Thursday night. You don&rsquo;t need to be home at  exactly that time to watch it. </p>
            <p>And you don&rsquo;t even have to  fire up the DVR to record it. That&rsquo;s because the show will be waiting for you  already, as part of the Free Primetime On Demand selections.</p>
            <img src="images/img/charter-on-demand-hd.jpg" class="img-left" alt="Charter On Demand HD"  /><p>Oh, and did you know that  1,500 of the 10,000 titles are offered in HD? Most of the recent movies are in  HD, so that ensures that you&rsquo;re always watching your favorite movie and TV  stars in full, glorious HD. </p>
            <p>You have the option to watch  in standard definition (SD), of course, but why would you possibly do that if  you can watch in HD on your big screen HDTV?</p>
            <p>And here&rsquo;s one more cool  thing about Charter Spectrum On Demand – you also get access to al the On  Demand offerings from the premium movie channels like HBO. Thus, as long as  you&rsquo;re getting HBO (by signing up for Silver or Gold), you can watch a full  archive of HBO shows and series. </p>
            <p>Maybe you&rsquo;re just dying to  re-watch &ldquo;The Sopranos&rdquo; – well, you don&rsquo;t have to go out and buy some box set  of DVDs to do that. Just use the On Demand offerings from HBO!</p>
            <h3 class="title-blue">Reason #6. Incredible Pay-Per-View offerings </h3>
            <img src="images/img/charter-ppv-events.jpg" class="img-right" alt="Charter PPV Events"  />
            <p>There are some events that  are so amazing and so epic that Charter Spectrum can only offer them on a  Pay-Per-View basis. This might be a killer heavyweight boxing match, or an epic  wrestling event, or some incredible MMA cage match. </p>
            <p>It can also include things  like concerts and other performances. What&rsquo;s so amazing about these PPV events  is that they are so exclusive. Some people specifically plan to go out to a bar  that&rsquo;s televising these events so that they can watch. </p>
            <p>But now you can just invite  people over to your house and watch on a big screen TV. PPV just rocks, and now  you get access to this incredible feature when you sign up for a Charter  Spectrum TV package.</p>
            <h3 class="title-blue">Reason #7. On-The-Go TV </h3>
            <p>Charter Spectrum is fully  committed to offering you TV in new, innovative ways. One of these is by  offering an on-the-go TV experience. There are 13 different mobile apps that  you can download in order to enjoy Charter Spectrum TV content. OK, that might  sound like a lot of apps to manage on your smartphone or tablet, but it&rsquo;s really   not.</p>
            <img src="images/img/charter-tv-on-the-go.jpg" class="img-left" alt="Charter Spectrum TV App"  /><p>Let&rsquo;s start with the Spectrum  TV app. You can think of this as your &ldquo;home base&rdquo; for navigating Charter  Spectrum on-the-go. This lets you watch 170 live TV channels anywhere you go in  your home on any one of your mobile devices. </p>
            <p>That&rsquo;s pretty awesome. And it  also lets you watch 60 networks on-the-go, even when you leave your house. This  includes a mix of networks offering sports, movies and shows.</p>
            <p>For most people, having 60 TV  networks to watch wherever they go would be more than enough. But you can see  why there have to be more apps than just the <a href="https://www.s9.com/charter/charter-tv-apps.html">Spectrum TV app</a>, right?  You might want to watch more than 60 TV networks. So you can just as easily  download the HBO app to watch HBO content on-the-go.</p>
            <p>In order to get the most out  of your Spectrum TV app, it&rsquo;s really best to pair with <a href="https://www.s9.com/charter/charter-internet-.html">Spectrum Internet</a>, which gives you in-home Wi-Fi. That lets you  stream content very easily. Since every square foot of your home is going to be  blanketed in Wi-Fi, which means you can use your mobile devices wherever you  go. </p>
            <p>For example, you might want  to watch a movie on your tablet before you go to bed in your bedroom. Or, you  might want to watch the end of a big football game in your kitchen while you&rsquo;re  preparing dinner. That&rsquo;s the real power of Charter Spectrum on-the-go –it frees  you up to enjoy TV content whenever and wherever.</p>
            <h3 class="title-blue">Reason #8. Best-in-class customer service </h3>
            <img src="images/img/charter-customer-service.jpg" class="img-right" alt="Charter Customer Service"  /><p>Charter Spectrum takes its  customers seriously, and is fully committed to offering best-in-class customer  service. You simply won&rsquo;t be treated better anywhere else you go. If you have a  problem with your service, you can always reach a (human) customer service  representative. </p>
            <p>And you won&rsquo;t have to worry  about a confusing &ldquo;tree&rdquo; of customer service options. This is one reason why  Charter Spectrum is so popular these days!</p>
            <p>This should give you a good  idea of how seriously Charter Spectrum takes customer service: the company has  been on a mission to hire 20,000 new customer service representatives! </p>
            <p>And the company is moving all  of its overseas call centers back to the United States! This makes things so  much better for customers. Every call is really going to be a chance to learn  more about Charter Spectrum.</p>
            <h3 class="title-blue">Reason #9. Charter Spectrum makes it easy to  switch </h3>
            <img src="images/img/charter-spectrum-service.jpg" class="img-left" alt="Charter Spectrum Service"  /><p>The main reason someone might  not want to switch to Charter Spectrum is because their current provider is  making it difficult – if not impossible – to do so. And can you blame that poor  competitor? </p>
            <p>That company knows the value  proposition of Charter Spectrum is so strong and so appealing that, as soon as  someone even samples Charter Spectrum content and services, they are going to  want to switch.</p>
            <p>And now Charter Spectrum is  making it a lot easier to do so. In one promotion the company is running now,  Charter Spectrum will buy out your existing contract for up to $500 in early  termination fees and penalties. That&rsquo;s pretty amazing, if you think about it. </p>
            <p>In other words, your current  service provider may be threatening you now with hundreds of dollars in &ldquo;fees&rdquo;  and &ldquo;penalties&rdquo; if you quit. Well, you can just laugh at their threats, because  Charter Spectrum will take care of all that for you. You&rsquo;re protected for up to  $500!</p>
            <h3 class="title-blue">Reason #10. Amazing bundles and bundle prices </h3>
            <img src="images/img/charter-bundle-deals.jpg" class="img-right" alt="Charter Bundles Deals"  /><p>Well, we&rsquo;ve saved the best  reason for last. Chances are, you&rsquo;re already convinced that Charter Spectrum TV  is the right choice for you. But there&rsquo;s one more way that Charter Spectrum is  going to sweeten the pot, and that&rsquo;s by making available some pretty insanely  attractive bundles. </p>
            <p>The most popular bundles are  known as &ldquo;Triple Play&rdquo; bundles. They&rsquo;re called &ldquo;Triple Play&rdquo; because they  involve 3 different Charter Spectrum services – TV, Internet and Voice. </p>
            <p>When you agree to subscribe  to all 3 at the same time, the pricing becomes incredibly low. For example,  with the Triple Play Select package, you will only pay $29.99 per month for  each service when bundled. </p>
            <p>If you decide to buy the  Triple Play Silver package, you will only pay an additional $20 on top of the  price of the Select package. And if you buy the Triple Play Gold package, you  will only pay an additional $20 on top of the price of the Silver package.</p>
            <p>And you should really take a  good look at how amazing those other services – Internet and Voice – really  are. With Internet, you&rsquo;re getting access to a minimum upload and download  speed of 60 Mbps. That&rsquo;s plenty fast for streaming movies, downloading music  and playing multi-player video games. And with <a href="https://www.s9.com/charter/charter-phone-.html">Spectrum Voice</a>, you&rsquo;re  getting access to free nationwide long-distance calling AND you get 18 popular  digital calling features.</p>
            <p>Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to  get the Triple Play. Some people prefer to get just the Double Play, such as TV  + Internet. But you don&rsquo;t save nearly as much money with the Double Play. </p>
            <p>You can do a few  back-of-the-envelope calculations here, comparing Charter Spectrum to other  service providers, and you can see that Charter Spectrum always seems to offer  the best pricing.</p>
            <p>For example, think of the  price difference involved in going from Triple Play Select to Triple Play  Silver. That&rsquo;s a total of $20. For that extra $20, you get more than 50  additional channels of TV content. </p>
            <p>And… you get HBO, Cinemax and  Showtime. If you tried to order HBO, Cinemax and Showtime separately from some  other provider, you&rsquo;d be paying way more than $20 per month.</p>
            <h4>Final takeaways </h4>
            <img src="images/img/charter-spectrum-bundles.jpg" class="img-right" alt="Charter Spectrum Bundles"  />
